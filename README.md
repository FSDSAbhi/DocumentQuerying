# DocumentQuerying
Document Querying with OpenAI, Langchain, and Pinecone
This repository contains an implementation for querying a document using the functionalities of OpenAI, Langchain, and Pinecone. With this setup, you can leverage the power of language models from OpenAI, the capabilities of blockchain-based document storage from Langchain, and the fast and scalable serving of machine learning models with Pinecone.

Prerequisites
Before running the code in this repository, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

  + Python 3.7 or higher
  + OpenAI
  + langchain==0.0.136
  + pinecone-client==2.2.1
  
   - Note: All the requirements are in the requirements.txt file
  
You will also need to obtain the necessary credentials and API keys for OpenAI, Langchain, and Pinecone to authenticate and access their services. Instructions on how to obtain these credentials can be found in the respective documentation of each service.
